Crime Scene Report â€“ [Create a Custom Scene Title]

Subject:
[1-2 sentences summarizing the scene with overdramatic comparisons to crime documentaries or action movies]

Whose [Object/Scene] Is This?

Profile:

[Quirky trait #1]

[Quirky trait #2] 

[Quirky trait #3]

What Might Have Happened Here?
[1-2 sentences describing dramatic scenarios that could have taken place]

Notable clues:

[Clue #1 with humorous suspicion]

[Clue #2 with sarcastic embellishment]

[Clue #3 with implied scandal]

[Clue #4 with oddly specific details]

[One central piece of evidence framed as key to the investigation]

How Might This Help Us Solve the Crime?
[How these clues could "crack the case" with exaggerated investigative methods]

Final Notes:
[Punchline conclusion categorizing the scene like "Suspiciously Innocent" or "Netflix Docuseries Waiting to Happen"]

Keep it under 500 words with dry wit and self-deprecating humor.`;
